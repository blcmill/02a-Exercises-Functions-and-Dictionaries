This is my response to Exercise 02a.

Here are some exercises to help you learn about Python functions, sets, and dictionaries. This is the second set of exercises for ILS-Z399. To complete these exercises:

Open the IDLE program that came with your Python installation. Use IDLE to interpret the Python code and answer the questions in the file.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line.

In the exercise file, you will see a series of Python statements followed by comment lines. Run the Python statements in IDLE and then add the answer to the comment on the following line.

For example, if the exercise contained these statements:
~~~ 
10 + 15
#
~~~
You would enter the statement 10 + 15 into IDLE. After hitting enter, IDLE returns 25, and so you would copy that response after the # on the following line.

Some of the exercises require you to interpret what is going on. Feel free to explore other variations in IDLE until you can come up with a reasonable explanation. 

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name), and edit this file to describe what your code does.
